This crate provides the ability to spawn processes with a function similar
to `thread::spawn`.  Instead of closures it passes [`serde`](https://serde.rs/)
serializable objects.  The return value from the spawned closure also must be
serializable and can then be retrieved from the returned join handle.

If the spawned function causes a panic it will also be serialized across
the process boundaries.

## Example

Step 1: invoke `procspawn::init` at a point early in your program (somewhere at
the beginning of the main function).  Whatever happens before that point also
happens in your spawned functions.

```rust
procspawn::init();
```

Step 2: now you can start spawning functions:

```rust
let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
let handle = procspawn::spawn(data, |data| {
    println!("Received data {:?}", &data);
    data.into_iter().sum::<i64>()
});
let result = handle.join().unwrap();
```
